# The Martian

## From Mars with love!

For this project I used Mars Rover Photos API from NASA:

https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?earth_date=2015-6-3&api_key=DEMO_KEY

## Implemented features:

- Getting photos by date between 2012-08-18 and 2021-12-21

- Getting/filtering photos by camera name

- Pagination with moving numbers

- A click on any image opens bigger image version in the dialog

- A click on a share icon copies image url to the clip board

- A click/unclick on the like icon saves/unsaves info in cookies

- Icons are animated
